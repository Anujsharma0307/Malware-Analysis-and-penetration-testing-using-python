# Malware-Analysis-and-penetration-testing-using-python

In this proposed work, the authors have deployed applications and designed malware for the purpose of simulating various kinds of cyber attacks so that they could study their effects & affects and ultimately devise solutions to resolve the vulnerabilities in a system. These applications included networking concepts & protocols and a software based keylogger which was developed with no malicious intent, but to analyse the architectural view or design of a malware and to study the stages of a malware attack like entry, distribution, exploitation, infection and execution. Efforts have been made to demonstrate spoofing attacks with an idea of identifying vulnerabilities and security loopholes in a particular system that can be exploited by an attacker if not resolved within time.

## Installation

The python script involved in the demonstration of the attacks can be downloaded via the repository or using following git commands 

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-all
```
The above command will install git command line tool in your system then you can follow the following procedure mentioned in this link 
to download the repository to your designated directory

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
