# Malware-Analysis-and-penetration-testing-using-python

In this proposed work, the authors have deployed applications and designed malware for the purpose of simulating various kinds of cyber attacks so that they could study their effects & affects and ultimately devise solutions to resolve the vulnerabilities in a system. These applications included networking concepts & protocols and a software based keylogger which was developed with no malicious intent, but to analyse the architectural view or design of a malware and to study the stages of a malware attack like entry, distribution, exploitation, infection and execution. Efforts have been made to demonstrate spoofing attacks with an idea of identifying vulnerabilities and security loopholes in a particular system that can be exploited by an attacker if not resolved within time.

## Installation

The python script involved in the demonstration of the attacks can be downloaded via the repository or using following git commands 

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-all
```
The above command will install git command line tool in your system then you can follow the following procedure mentioned in [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) link 
to download the repository to your designated directory.

## Attacks and Python Scripts involved

The report demonstates a list of simultaneous command line attacks on a vulnearble Linux based system. The attacks involved are following-

1. ARP Spoofing
2. File Interception
3. MAC Address Changer
4. DNS Spoofing
5. Malware
6. Network Scanner
7. Packet Sniffer


## Usage

Usage and chronology of the simulataneous attacks has been demonstrated in the 'Malware Analysis Report' in the repository
